📋 API Documentation

The FastAPI framework automatically generates interactive API documentation. Once the server is running, visit:

    Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

🧠 Connecting to the ML Model

This API is designed to facilitate seamless communication with ML models. Add your ML models under the app/models/ directory and integrate them into the service layer.

Example ML Integration:

      
from app.models.your_model import YourModel

def predict(data):
    model = YourModel()
    return model.predict(data)
